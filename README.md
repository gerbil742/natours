The Natours project is the main project behind the 42 hour Udemy course "Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2022" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
I will be following along with the instructor as he develops the project.
I will be pushing all the code we have written in the project to Github in order to get more pratice using github and to showcase what i have learned throughout the course.
